Work in the current repository. Use these files as your source of truth:

## Primary Context Files
- `.opencode/plans/prd.json` - The PRD JSON file with all features and their status
- `.opencode/plans/autocomplete-rearchitecture.md` - Detailed architecture plan with code signatures and algorithm descriptions
- `progress.txt` - Progress log for the project

## Feature Selection
Find the highest-priority PENDING feature to work on (lowest priority number = highest priority).
Work only on features with status "pending". Skip features with status "completed" or "in_progress".

## Reference Code (for autocomplete refactor)
When implementing C3 core or PostgreSQL completer features, reference these Bytebase files:
- C3 Algorithm: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bytebase/bytebase/main/backend/plugin/parser/base/c3.go
- Scanner: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bytebase/bytebase/main/backend/plugin/parser/base/scanner.go
- PG Completer: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bytebase/bytebase/main/backend/plugin/parser/pg/completion.go

Port the algorithm logic, adapting to our simpler architecture:
- Use our existing MetadataProvider interface (internal/parser/metadata.go)
- Use our existing SchemaCache (internal/parser/schema_cache.go)
- Import PostgreSQL parser as: github.com/bytebase/postgresql-parser

## Quality Gates
Ensure code quality, build, and tests all pass using Go tooling:

1. Run golangci-lint run
2. Run go build ./...
3. Run go test ./...

Fix any issues before marking the feature complete.

## Updating Progress
1. Update the PRD JSON file:
   - Set the feature's "status" to "completed"
   - Add any notes about implementation decisions

2. Append your progress to progress.txt:
   - Date and feature ID
   - What was implemented
   - Any gotchas or notes for the next person
   - Files created/modified

3. Make a git commit with format: "feat(parser): [Feature ID] - [Title]"

## Rules
- ONLY WORK ON A SINGLE FEATURE per session
- Follow the acceptance_criteria in the PRD exactly
- Create files in the locations specified by files_to_create
- Do not skip ahead to later features even if they seem easier
- If a feature depends on previous work, ensure those features are completed first

If, while implementing the feature, you notice the PRD is complete (all features have status "completed"), output:
<promise>COMPLETE</promise>
